# BackupClicker
Latest version, changes and downloads can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/cameron2134/backupclicker/releases/latest">Releases</a> page



## Description
BackupClicker is a simple application I created for myself after being unsatisfied with various other backup programs I had tried, and wanted to create an application that would make it easy to back up directories I use often. It is intended to be fairly simple and easy to use, with minimal user interaction to start the backup process, especially after the user has saved commonly backed up directories, which are then loaded when the application starts, allowing the user to simply click once to open the application, then click again to start the backup.



## Installation
Installation is simple, simply extract the contents of the .zip into a folder, and run BackupClicker.exe, and make sure all the corresponding folders and files are in the same location as the .exe

To open the application, simply run BackupClicker.exe with <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html">Java Runtime Environment 8</a> or higher.


## User Guide
**On first use:**

1. Open application
  1. Click 'Select Directories' to choose the directories you wish to backup
  2. Click 'Select Target' to choose the destination for the backups
  3. Click 'Save Directories' if you want to load these directories on application startup for ease of use
2. Begin the backup by clicking on 'Backup'
  1. Wait for the backup to complete by monitoring the progress bar

**Otherwise:**

1. Open application. Previously saved directories will auto-load if you saved any
2. Begin the backup
